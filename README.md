# What’s Your Mood Today?  
**A CSS Mood Showcase Project by Suzette-Nicole Young**

Welcome to *What’s Your Mood Today?* — a playful, stylish, and skill-packed web project where HTML and CSS team up to express a little personality. This project was created to demonstrate mastery of **all three types of CSS styling** (inline, internal, external) — with a splash of sparkle, a touch of JavaScript, and a whole lot of vibe.

## Why This Project?

This site is more than a mood board — it’s a **CSS playground**. The goal was to show how the same HTML structure can **transform visually and emotionally** through creative CSS styling. From peaceful to powerful to playful — each mood brings its own look and energy.

## Features

- **3 Mood Themes**:
  - *Calm*: Soft colors and a relaxed serif font
  - *Bold*: High contrast with strong typography
  - *Playful*: Bright colors and bouncy fonts

  - **Inline**: Styled directly on elements (buttons, headings, links)
  - **Internal**: Defined in the `<style>` tag inside the HTML head
  - **External**: Structured layout in a separate `style.css` file

- **Sparkle Animation** (because why not?)
- **Dynamic JavaScript Mood Switcher**
- **Responsive layout** with flexbox
- **Google Fonts** + **Font Awesome** icons
- **SEO metadata** and accessibility-friendly structure
